 # NAND Gate

 Now that we finished our lessons with the basic gates,
 it's time to look at some combined gates!
 
 And the first combined gate to learn is the NAND gate(⊼)!
 As the name suggests, it's a combination of NOT gate and AND gate.
 
 And if you heard about something like 'NAND flash chip', this is the gate used in that chip!
 
 - Callout(Goal):
  Make 178 to the result byte.
