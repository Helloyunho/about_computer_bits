 # XNOR Gate
 
 So here comes another weird,
 probably weirdest gate in this playground,
 XNOR gate.
 This is the last gate we're gonna learn!
 
 Some people call this  NXOR gate and I think this makes more sense
 but just interpret it as you wish.
 
 And here goes another fun fact:
 - Note:
  You can use the XNOR gate to check if both bits are the same value.
 
 And here goes another goal:
 - Callout(Goal):
  Make 255(the maximum value of byte)!
