 # NOT Gate
 
 Now, we're going to do some calculations with some bits!
 In the computer world, we use gates to calculate.
 
 The first gate we're gonna look at is NOT(or inverter) gate.
 
 This gate, as you might guess, inverts the bits.
 Like 1 to 0, and 0 to 1!
 
 The green button below will light up if you turn off the matching bits.
 
 Try it!
