 # AND Gate
 
 The second gate is AND gate(⋀)!
 
 It checks if the two bits are all 1.
 If it is, then it gives us 1,
 otherwise, we will get 0.
 
 There will be two bytes on the right,
 and the result byte will be shown as a green button.
 Again, you can go to the next page by pressing the green button!
