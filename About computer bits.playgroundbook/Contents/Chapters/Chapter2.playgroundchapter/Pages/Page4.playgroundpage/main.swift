 # XOR Gate
 
 Now this time, we're gonna be looking at a weird gate I would say...
 which is called XOR gate(⊻)!
 
 As the name suggests it behaves a bit similar to OR gate,
 but the difference is that it also returns 0 when two bits are equally 1.
 
 And to add some fun to this playground, let's make a goal...
 
 - Callout(Goal):
  Make 42 to the result byte.
