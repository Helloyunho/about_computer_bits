 # Small Playground
 
 **Congratulation!** ðŸŽ‰
 You mastered how the computer bits and bytes are working!
 
 As a small present,
 I made a small playground where you can play with some bits and make some letters!
 
 Here, you can make a text (such as 'Hello, Yunho') using bytes.
 
 Have fun, and try using every gate and trick we learned!
 
 - Note:
  Again, you can touch(click) the number on the byte to see the number converted into a letter!
