 # Shifting Bits
 
 In this chapter, we're going to shift the bits.
 
 Shifting means pushing 0 to the left, or right side.
 
 So for example, byte 10100101 shifted right side is 01001010,
 and the same byte shifted left side is 01010010.
 
 - Callout(Goal):
  Make 180 by shifting the existing bits on the right side.

 * Note:
  You might lose some bits while trying some errors.
  When this happens, just go back to the previous page and come back here.
